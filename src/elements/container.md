These options influence how the element displays.

1. ***Gap*** - The gap option allows you to specify the gap between child elements on the main axis. Current browser support is 89.92%. In order to increase browser support, you can use margins
2. ***Flex direction*** - The flex-direction CSS property sets how flex items are placed in the flex container defining the main axis and the direction (normal or reversed).
3. ***Align items*** - The CSS align-items property sets the align-self value on all direct children as a group. In Flexbox, it controls the alignment of items on the Cross Axis. In Grid Layout, it controls the alignment of items on the Block Axis within their grid area.
4. ***Justify*** - The CSS justify-content property defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main-axis of a flex container, and the inline axis of a grid container.
5. ***Wrap*** - If you choose to wrap the content, all inner elements will be placed on a new line if there is no space for them on the same line.
6. ***Align content*** - The CSS align-content property sets the distribution of space between and around content items along a flexbox's cross-axis or a grid's block axis.

1. ***Flex grow*** - The flex-grow CSS property sets the flex grow factor of a flex item's main size
2. ***Flex shrink*** - The flex-shrink CSS property sets the flex shrink factor of a flex item. If the size of all flex items is larger than the flex container, items shrink to fit according to flex-shrink.
3. ***Flex basis*** - The flex-basis CSS property sets the initial main size of a flex item. It sets the size of the content box unless otherwise set with box-sizing
4. ***Align self*** - The align-self CSS property overrides a grid or flex item's align-items value. In Grid, it aligns the item inside the grid area. In Flexbox, it aligns the item on the cross axis.
5. ***Order*** - Select if you want your element to be displayed first or last inside the parent container. Please not that in order for this to work, the parent container must be displayed as **flex**.
