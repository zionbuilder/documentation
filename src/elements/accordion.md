## General info

The accordion element allows you to display text ( or nested elements with Zion Builder PRO ) in a collapsed manner. This allows the users of your website decide if they want to expand the accordion to see the content or not.

Using PRO you are not limited by just text as the accordion content and you can add any other Zion Builder element.

::: tip
When activating Zion Builder PRO, all accordion text content will be converted automatically into text elements that can be individually configured.
