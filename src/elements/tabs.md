## General info

The tabs element is a graphical user interface component commonly used in web pages and applications to organize and display content in a structured way. It consists of a set of horizontally arranged tabs, each representing a different category or section of content. When a user clicks on a tab, the associated content is displayed while the content from other tabs is hidden. Tabs are often used to conserve screen space and improve the usability of an interface by providing a clear and intuitive way to navigate between related sections of content.

Using PRO you are not limited by just text as the tab content and you can add any other Zion Builder element.

::: tip
When activating Zion Builder PRO, all tabs text content will be converted automatically into text elements that can be individually configured.
