# Free vs pro

## Zion Builder Free

Zion Builder Free is a powerful page builder that allows you to easily create professional-looking websites without any coding knowledge. With an advanced drag-and-drop interface and a wide range of blocks & templates, you can create beautiful and functional pages with ease.

## Zion Builder Pro

Zion Builder Pro, on the other hand, is an upgraded version of Zion Builder FREE that offers additional features and options. Some of the key differences between the two versions include the ability to use custom fonts and create advanced designs, access to more blocks & templates, and the ability to edit your website's header and footer. Additionally, Zion Builder Pro offers advanced tools and features, such as pop-up builder, theme-builder, dynamic data, and repeater functionality, ACF & Meta Box integration, as well as WooCommerce integration for building online stores. In general, Zion Builder Pro provides a more comprehensive and versatile website-building experience than the free version.
